The Business Order and Delivery Program is a Java-based application that allows customers to place orders for various services offered by businesses and schedule an appointment for 1 out of 4 offered services.  The following services are mobile car wash, grocery delivery, home cleaning, and pet grooming.  The program accounts for errors by validating the input data and ensuring they select the proper services, a proper date, and the time falls within business hours.  Then the program outputs an order summary to a text file and saves the customer order history.

Basic Instructions
To use this program you enter text-based answers responding to each of the program's questions.  
First, the program will prompt you for your name
Then you can select a service by inputting a number (1-4) or 0 to exit
Next, enter an appointment date in the correct format YYYY-MM-DD
Then enter an appointment time in the correct format HH:MM: AM/PM (within business hours 08:00 AM - 08:00 PM)
Finally, the customer's order summary will be displayed on the screen and saved as a text file.
Type exit to quit the program
